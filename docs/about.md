DeckMaster is a *prototype* deck editor application for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. 
Still in the development phase, a lot of features have not yet been implemented and those that have are experimental. 

I plan to add a lot to DeckMaster, including an undo/redo system, a combo editor (for consistency), plugin capability, and more. 
I lay out my plans in the project roadmap, so feel free to take a look at what is to come. 

DeckMaster is also completely open-source, and is distributed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
