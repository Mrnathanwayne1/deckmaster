## YGOPro/EDOPro Path

This setting defines the path to the folder containing your YGOPro/EDOPro app.
The folder should contain `YGOPro.exe` or `EDOPro.exe` along with folders like `pics` and `deck`.

## Reset All Settings

As the name states, this resets all of DeckMaster's settings.
However, this will not delete any decks/combos you have created with DeckMaster.
