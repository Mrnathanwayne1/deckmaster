# Roadmap to 1.0.0

This roadmap shows what needs to be completed before the initial full version (`1.0.0`). 
Things may be added/removed over time if I change my mind about what should be in `1.0.0`. 

- [ ] Settings menu
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut API
- [ ] Undo/Redo system
- [ ] Context menu when right click on deck or a card in deck
- [ ] Combo Editor (using `.ycb` extension (**Y**u-Gi-Oh! **C**om**b**o))
- [ ] Custom CSS library (iridium.css)


## Future Plans

This is a list of things that may be added in a future release.
For now though, I have no plans to implement anything here yet.
